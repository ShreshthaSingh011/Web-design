# Learning Accessibility by building a Quiz Application
Accessibility is making our webpage easy for all people to use – even people with disabilities. In this course, I built a quiz webpage. I learned accessibility tools such as keyboard shortcuts, ARIA attributes, and design best practices.
ARIA attributes or Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) is a set of rules and attributes that define ways to make web content and web applications (especially those developed with JavaScript) more accessible to people with disabilities.
It supplements HTML so that interactions and widgets commonly used in applications can be passed to assistive technologies when there is not otherwise a mechanism. For example, ARIA enables accessible JavaScript widgets, form hints and error messages, live content updates, and more.
